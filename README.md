# Master-Thesis---Weyl-hydrodynamics
In my Master Thesis I used linear response theory to compute all the thermoelectric transport coefficients for a Weyl semimetal, using a relativistic hydrodynamic model.
Here you can find the Mathematica nootbook I wrote to perform the calculations that appear in my work.
