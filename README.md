# Master-Thesis - Weyl-hydrodynamics
In my Master Thesis I used linear response theory to compute all the thermoelectric transport coefficients for a Weyl semimetal, using a relativistic hydrodynamic model.
Here you can find the Mathematica nootbook I wrote to perform the calculations that appear in my work.

In "TESI.nb" you can find my first computation.
"TESI - omega_e = omega_c = omega.nb" you can find the second version of the program, in which I applied the fix needed to recover the usual magnetohydrodynamic expressions for the thermoelectric transverse transport coefficients.
"diffgeoManual.nb" is the manual for the diffgeo package that I used in my work.
